# Ensemble Learning

## Slides
I tried to use [revealjs](https://revealjs.com/) to make my slides this time.

To open the slides, just open the file `slides/index.html` in your favorite browser and, I think,
everything will work.

To navigate through the slides,
- either use the arrow keys on your keyboard
    - PageUp, PageDn also work somewhat, it seems
- or use vim-like `hjkl`
- or you can also use mouse to click (although it seems slow to do so)


## Jupyter Notebooks
They are ordered alphabetically. However, it is better that you read the slides
and only come to the Jupyter notebooks when you are told to.
