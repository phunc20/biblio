I find that during the first edit, I tend to

- make mistakes
- want to record everything, even mistakes and their corrections

So I decided to name my Pluto notebooks by `_v01`, `_v02`, etc.
to denote the version according to chronological order.

**Rmk.** `_v` means **version** as well as **verbose**. Maybe there
will bi `_c` in the future, meaning **concise**.


## Environment
- To have the `TikzPictures`-drawn picture work on Debian, to my own experience, in addition to the standard TeX package, one need `sudo apt install texlive-luatex` as well.
